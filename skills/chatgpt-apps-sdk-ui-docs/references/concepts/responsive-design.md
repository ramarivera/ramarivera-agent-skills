# Responsive design

## Build adaptive interfaces with Apps SDK UI

## Approach

Styles should be written **mobile-first**, meaning the base styles are applied to all screen sizes. Then, responsive styles are added that take effect at specific breakpoints and _above_.

In practice this may look like starting with a single column layout, then introducing multiple columns at certain breakpoints, when sufficient screen width is available.

## Default breakpoints

Default breakpoints are provided out-of-the-box with Apps SDK UI, and are integrated into Tailwind and React utilities.

| **Name** | **Size** | **Common device** | **Example usage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xs` | `380px` | Portrait mobile | Applying styles to very small screens (by default), then using this breakpoint to override |
| `sm` | `576px` | Landscape mobile, phablet | Collapsed mobile menu<br>Single-column list/detail views |
| `md` | `768px` | Tablet | Expanded primary navigation<br>Fixed left sidebar navigation |
| `lg` | `1024px` | Laptop | Tight column layouts<br>Sticky sidebar in API Ref |
| `xl` | `1280px` | Desktop | Spacious column layouts |
| `2xl` | `1536px` | Widescreen | Largest screen sizes, widescreen viewing |

## Usage

### Tailwind

Use standard Tailwind paradigms for writing responsive utility classes. See the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) for more details.

```
// Use flex columns by default, then convert to flex row at "lg" and up
<div className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row"></div>

```

### React

Use our React hook for detecting breakpoints in your components.

```
import { useBreakpoint } from "@openai/apps-sdk-ui/hooks/useBreakpoint";

function SampleComponent() {
  const isMediumBreakpoint = useBreakpoint("md"); // true or false
}

```
